# ASeriesOfUnfortunateBugs

---

My personal webpage and portfolio.

I built this page from scratch using HTML and standard CSS. My goal was to showcase my design and development skills as well as provide a space to share my other projects with potential employers/collaborators.

During the design process, I wanted to come up with something that reflected my style and personality. I am what I like to call a spooky person so I knew I wanted to use black as the main color. I also felt like this would be an interesting challenge as many webpages use white as the default. I wanted to challenge myself to make a sleek and graceful design using the color black instead.

It's my plan to work up some redesigns in the future and incorporate a dropdown menu where the user can pick from a list of design options.
